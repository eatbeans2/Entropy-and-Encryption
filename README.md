# Entropy-and-Encryption
Final project attempting to affect (and measure) the unicity distance of ciphers by creating an expanded alphabet. This project is poorly organized, poorly implemented, and poorly documented. I will attempt to clean it up.

AphineCipher.py uses a simple cipher to encrypt or decrypt text via a key.
