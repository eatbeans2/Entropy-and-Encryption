Measuring redundancy in a program:
Shannon entropy:
	H(A)=-1*Sum(i=1, n, p_i*log_2(p_i))
	H(A)<=log_2(n)
		H(A)=log_2(n) iff p(a_i)=1/n for all i
Absolute redundancy:
	D=R-r
	D=Absolute redundancy
	R=Absolute rate=log|M|, M is cardinality of alphabet
	r=rate=lim(n->infinity, (1/n)*H(M_1,M_2,...,M_n)
	joint entropy of first n symbols divided by n

NOTE: create fake variable statistics by using overlapping confidence intervals and weighting connected confidence intervals by corresponding character entropy

NOTE:
I have the joint entropy for 2 and 3 characters

NOTE:
Consider including spaces in entropy calculations? should spaces be encrypted? dunno.
Are these two issues related? Probably.
